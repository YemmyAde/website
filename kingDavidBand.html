            ABOUT KING DAVID
            -(Beloved)
            King David is the second king of the United Kingdom of Isreal, an ancestor of Jesus Christ, and writer of numerous Psalms. The record of David’s life is found in I Samuel 16-31; 2 Samuel 1:24; Kings 1-2; and I Chronicles 10:29. An Aramaic inscription including the words “house (dynasty) of David” was found in 1993 in the ruins of the city of Dan. It dates to the 9th century B.C. and is the only known mention of David’s ancient contemporary writing outside of the Old Testament itself.<br> <br>
            David as a Youth
            David’s youth was spent in Bethlehem. The youngest of eight brothers (I Sam. 16:10-11; 17:12-14), he was the son of Jesse, a respected citizen of the city. His mother was tenderly remembered for godliness (Ps. 86:16). As the youngest son, David was the keeper of his father’s sheep. In this job, he showed courage and faithfulness by killing both a lion and bear that attacked the flock.
            As a lad, he displayed outstanding musical talent with the harp, a fact that figured prominently in his life. When Saul was rejected by God as king, the Prophet Samuel went to Bethlehem to anoint David as the future king of Israel. Apparently, there was no public announcement of this event, although David and his father surely must have been aware of it. <br> <br>
            David’s Service Under Saul
            King Saul, forsaken by God and troubled by an evil spirit, was subject to moods of depression and insanity. His attendants advised him to secure a harpist, whose music might soothe his spirit. David was recommended for this task. As harpist for Saul, David was exposed to governmental affairs, a situation that prepared him for his later service as king of Israel. Apparently, David did not remain with Saul all the time, since the Bible indicates he returned to Bethlehem to continue caring for his father’s sheep.<br> <br>
            During all these visits to his home, the Philistines invaded the country and camped 24 kilometres (15miles) west of Bethlehem. Saul led the army of Israel to meet the enemy. Three of David’s brothers were in Saul’s army, and Jesse sent David to the battle area to inquire about their welfare. While on his expedition, David encountered the PHILISTINE giant GOLIATH.<br> <br>
            David as Warrior
            Goliath’s challenge for an Isrealite to do battle with him stirred David’s spirit. Weighted with heavy armour, Goliath was well equipped to be engaged in close range combat. David’s strategy was to fight him at a distance. Taking five smooth stones from a brook, David faced Goliath with only a sling and his unflinching faith in God. Goliath fell, struck by a stone from David’s sling. For this feat, he became a hero in the eyes of the nation. But it aroused jealousy and animosity in the heart of Saul. Saul’s son, JONATHAN, however, admired David because of his bravery, and they soon became good friends. This friendship lasted until Jonathan’s death, in spite of Saul’s hostility toward David.<br> <br>
            Saul had promised to make the victor in the battle with Goliath his son-in-law and presented one of his daughters as his wife; Saul also promised to free the victor’s family from taxation. But after the battle, David was no longer allowed to return occasionally to his father’s house. He remained at Saul’s palace continually. As David’s popularity grew, Saul’s fear increased until he could no longer hide his desire to kill him. David was forced to flee with Saul in pursuit.<br> <br>
            David as Fugitive Hero
            David gathered a handful of fugitives as his followers and fled from Saul. On at least two occasions, David could have killed Saul while the king slept, but he refused to do so. Perhaps David hesitated to kill Saul because he realized that he would be king one day, and he wanted the office to be treated with respect. If he had killed Saul, David also would have entered the office of king through his own personal violence, perhaps this was a situation he wanted to avoid.
            When the Philistines battled Saul and his army at Gilboa, they were victorious, killing Saul and his son, Jonathan, whom David loved as a dear friend. When David heard this news, he mourned their fate. (2 Samuel I). <br> <br>

            David as King of Judah
            At Saul’s death the tribe of Judah, to whom David belonged, elected him as king of Judah and placed him on the throne in Hebron. The rest of the civil war raged between these two factions. It ended in the assassination of Ishbosheth, an event that saddened David.<br> <br>
            He immediately began work to establish a United Kingdom. One of his first acts as king was to attack the fortified city of Jebus. Although the inhabitants thought it was too safe from capture, David and his army took it. He then made it the capital city of his kingdom and erected his palace there. Also known as Jerusalem, the new capital stood on the border of the southern tribe of Judah and the other tribal territories to the North. This location tended to calm the jealousies between the north and the south, contributing greatly to the unity of the kingdom.<br> <br>
            After establishing his new political capital, David proceeded to re-establish and strengthen the worship of God. He moved the Ark of the covenant from Kirjath Jearim (Josh. 15:9) and placed it within a tabernacle that he pitched in Jerusalem. Next, he organized worship on a magnificent scale and began plans to build a house of worship. But God brought a halt to his plans, informing David that the building of the Temple would be entrusted to his successor.<br> <br>
            Although David was a righteous king, he was subject to sin, just like other human beings. On one occasion when his army went to battle, David stayed home. This led to his great sin with Bathsheba. While Uriah the Hittite, Bathsheba’s husband, was away in battle, David committed adultery with her. Then in an effort to cover his sin, he finally had Uriah killed in battle. David was confronted by the prophet Nathan, who courageously exposed his wrong-doing. Faced with his sin, David repented and asked for God’s forgiveness. His prayer for forgiveness is recorded in Psalm 51.<br> <br>
            Although God forgave David of this act of adultery, the consequences of the sin continued to plauge him. The child born to David and Bathsheba died. The example he set as a father was a bad influence on his sons. One of his sons, Amnon raped and humiliated his half-sister. Another son, Absalom, rebelled against David and tried to take away his kingdom by force. One of David’s deep desires was to build a temple in Jerusalem. But he was prevented from doing so. <br> <br>The prophet Nathan informed David that he would not build the temple because he had been a warrior. David did not build the temple, but he did gather materials for the temple to be built later. It was Solomon, David’s son and successor, who finally erected the first temple in Jerusalem. David died when he was 71 years old, having been king for total over 40 years, including both his reign in Hebron and his kingship over the United Kingdom.
