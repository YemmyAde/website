            Mary is the name of six women in the New Testament. The most prominent is Mary the mother of Jesus and the role model of members of the Band
            Mary, the mother of Jesus (Luke 1:2) <br> <br>
            We know nothing of Mary’s background other than that she was pleasant and a resident of Nazareth, a city of Galilee. She must have been of the tribe of Judah and thus in the line of David (Luke 1:32), although the genealogies in Matthew 6 and Luke 3 do not say so, because they traced Joseph genealogy rather than Mary’s. We do know that Mary’s cousin, Elizabeth, was the mother of John the Baptist.<br> <br>
            When Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, the carpenter, Angel Gabriel appeared to her, calling her “highly favoured one” and “blessed among women” (Luke 1:28). The Angel announced the birth of the Messiah. After Gabriel explained how such a thing could be possible, Mary said, “Let it be to me according to your word” (Luke1: 38). That Mary “found favour with God”: and was allowed to give birth to the promised Messiah indicated that she must have been of good character and great faith. <br> <br>
            When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, Mary “wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger” (Luke 2:7). She witnessed the visits of the shepherds and the Wisemen and “pondered them in her heart” (Luke 2: 19). She heard Simeon’s prophecy of a sword that would pierce through his own soul (Luke 2: 35). Joseph and Mary fled to Egypt to escape Herod’s murder of all males under two years old (Matt. 2:13-18). Neither Mary nor Joseph appeared again until Jesus was 12 years Old; at which time, he stayed behind in the temple with the teachers (Luke 2: 41-52). Both Mary and Joseph accepts Jesus’ explanation, realizing he was Israel’s Promised One.<br> <br>
            Mary was present at Jesus first miracle – the turning of water into wine at the wedding feast in Cana of Galilee (John 2: 1-12). Mary seemed to be asking her Son to use His power to meet the crisis. Jesus warned her that His time had not yet come. Nevertheless, he turned the water into wine. At another time, Mary and Jesus brothers wished to see him while He was teaching the multitudes, perhaps to warn Him of impending danger. But again Jesus mildly rebuked her, declaring that the bond between Him and His disciples was stronger than any family ties (Luke 8: 19-21).<br> <br>
            The scriptures do not mention Mary again until she stands at the foot of the cross (John 19: 25-27). No mention is made of Joseph; he likely was dead for some time. Jesus’ brothers were not among His followers. Of his family, only His mother held fast to her belief in His Messiahship – even though it appeared to be ending in tragedy. From the cross, Jesus gave Mary over to the care of the beloved disciple, John. The last mention of Mary is in the upper room in Jerusalem, awaiting the coming of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1: 14). It is not known how or when Mary died. The Tomb of the Virgin is in the valley of Kidron in Jerusalem, south-east of the Temple area; but there is no historical basis for this site.<br> <br>

            According to the Scriptures, Jesus had four brothers, namely; James, Joses, Judas, and Simon, and an unnamed sister (Matt. 13:55-56; Mark 6:3). The Roman Catholic Church, however, claims that Mary remained a Virgin; and that these brothers and sister were either Joseph’s children by an earlier marriage or were cousins of Jesus. Legends concerning Mary began circulating in written form as early as the fifth century, but there is no valid historical evidence for them.<br> <br> In reaction to the Roman Catholic teaching about Mary, many Protestants almost neglected her and her contributions of what can be said of her that is consistent with Holy Scripture
God was in her womb. In conceiving and bearing the Lord Jesus Christ, she gave earthly birth not to a mere man but to the Son of God Himself. She conceived as a virgin through the mysterious power of the Holy Spirit. We are to bless and honour her, for as she herself said she was under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, “Henceforth all generations will call me blessed” (Luke 1:48).
<br> <br>
As the first member of the human race to accept Christ, she stands as the first of the redeemed and as the flagship of humanity itself. She is an enduring example for faith, service to God, and a life of righteousness.
