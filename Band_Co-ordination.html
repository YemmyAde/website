       <p class="textFlex1">Introduction </p>
        The Church and its leadership have onerous task to attend to the physical, spiritual, emotional, material, etc.
        needs of its members. These needs include but are not limited to providing advice and prayers on almost
        everything i.e. sickness, barrenness, seeking employment, laying of foundation stones, house warming, marriage,
        among others. The Church and its leadership also have spiritual and moral obligation to visitors and indeed
        everyone seeking the face of God in all aspects.<br><br>
        For ease of administration in attending to the rapid growth and development of the Church whilst not neglecting
        the spiritual, welfare and social needs of its members and visitors alike, the Church created Bands. The Band
        provides a forum where the spiritual, physical, material, welfare and social needs of members can be easily met.
        It also serves as a forum to spiritually and physically empower members for personal and spiritual growth and
        development, particularly within the body of Christ and in the secular world. <br><br>

        <p class="textFlex1">BANDS</p>
Bands are prayer groups formed for members of the Church – male and female, to supplement and complement the spiritual, social and welfare needs of the members to attain maximum efficiency for the overall development of the congregation at large. They pray together, attend to the spiritual, physical, material, emotional, social, etc. needs of members. The activities of the Bands are appropriately coordinated and monitored to ensure that the goals and objectives which include spiritual growth and physical well-being of members, etc. are on course. Bands are primarily administrative machineries by the Church to achieve its goals; and it also guarantees seamless linkages between the Church Leadership and individual members of the Church (Exodus 18:19-26). <br><br>
Generally, the Bands are named after notable characters/personalities in the Bible such as King David Band, Prophetess Anna Band, Mary Band, etc.; or named after critical issues of significance in the Bible such as Soldiers of Christ Band, Show the Glory of God (Fogo) Band, etc.<br><br>
