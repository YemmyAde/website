      <p data-aos="fade-down" data-aos-delay="300">
        This is the name of several men in the Bible. Of all of them, Jacob’s eleventh son is the most prominent.
        Joseph was the name of the 11th son of Jacob (Gen 30:24). He was sold into slavery and later rose to an
        important position in the Egyptian government. The account of Joseph’s life is found in Genesis 37-50. He was
        the first child of Rachel (Gen. 30:24) and his father’s favorite son (Gen. 37:31). <br><br>This is most clearly
        shown by the special coat that Jacob gave to Joseph. The favoritism eventually brought serious trouble for the
        whole family. Joseph’s ten older brothers hated him because he was their father’s favorite and because Joseph
        had dreams, which when interpreted, brought in unhealthy, envy and mischief towards Joseph. It is no surprise
        that Joseph’s brothers hated him enough to want to kill him (37:4).<br><br>
        Joseph's brothers were shepherds in the land of Canaan. Jacob sent Joseph to search for his brothers who were
        tending the flocks in the fields. When Joseph found them, the brothers seized him and wanted to kill him but for
        Reuben only who opposed them. <br><br>
      </p>

    <div class="textColumn2 textSpace">
      <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="500">Joseph was eventually sold into slavery to passing merchants; and they dipped his beautiful coat in animal
        blood to convince Jacob their father that Joseph had been killed by wild animals (37:34- 35).
        Joseph was taken to Egypt where he was sold to Potiphar, an officer of the ruling King Pharaoh of Egypt.
        Joseph’s good conduct in his new abode soon earned him the highest position in the household of Potiphar. But
        the wife of Potiphar soon became infatuated with Joseph and tempted him to commit adultery with her.
        <br><br>When he refused, she accused him of crime and Joseph was sent to prison. While in prison, Joseph’s
        behavior earned him a position of responsibility over the other prisoners. Joseph met Pharaoh Baker and his
        Butler while in the prison among other prisoners. When each of them dreamt, Joseph interpreted their dreams.
        <br><br>When the butler left the prison, he failed to intercede on Joseph’s behalf and Joseph spent two more
        years in prison.
        When Pharaoh had dream that none if his counselors could interpret, the butler remembered Joseph and mentioned
        him to the Pharaoh. Then Joseph was called to appear before Pharaoh.<br><br> </p>

        He interpreted Pharaoh’s dreams, predicting seven years of bountiful harvest to be followed by seven years of
        famine. Pharaoh appointed Joseph as Prime Minister to his surprise. This was a position of great prestige (Gen.
        41:37- 57). Joseph was second only to Pharaoh in power. People from surroundings lands came to buy food from
        him.<br><br>
        The famine also struck Canaan and Joseph’s brothers eventually came to Egypt to buy grain. When they met Joseph,
        they did not recognize him. He however recognized them and decided to task them to see if they had changed. He
        accused them of being spies. <br><br>Then he sold grain to his brothers on the ground that Simeon stayed back as
        a hostage until they brought Benjamin (his younger brother and the last son of his father) to Egypt with them
        (Gen 42:14- 24). <br><br>Joseph was overcome with emotion when the brothers returned to Egypt with Benjamin. He
        revealed himself to them as their brother whom they had sold into slavery.Joseph forgiveness was genuine. He
        sent them back to Canaan with gifts for his father and invited
        the family to come and live in Egypt. <br><br>

        The grace of God working in the family of Jacob is evident in the way Joseph dealt with his personal suffering
        which preserved the family as instrument of God’s will. Joseph also was aware that his rise to power was for the
        good of his family not for his own glory (Gen. 45:7-8).
        Other men named Joseph in the Bible included:<br><br>
